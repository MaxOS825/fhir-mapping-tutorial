# FHIR tutorial mapping example
FHIR has a mapping language to convert between logical models an a nice [tutorial](http://build.fhir.org/mapping-tutorial.html) how use it, this projects tries to build the structure definitions and mappings for it.

ATTENTION: work in progress, to be run the fhir source from gforge has to checked out and run. 

The [validator](http://build.fhir.org/validation.html) has also the possiblity to run the transforms, this functionality however is in the current build (date 06-06-2017) not activated.

```
java -jar org.hl7.fhir.validator.jar ../maptutorial/step1/source/source1.xml -ig ../maptutorial/st
ep1/logical/structuredefinition-tleft.xml -ig ../maptutorial/step1/logical/structuredefinition-tright.xml -defn igpack.zip -transform -map
 ../maptutorial/step1/map/step1.map -output ./step1.xml
```


## java based testing setup

eclipse based configuration

```
import projects fhir/build/implementations/java/org.hl7.fhir.r4
import projects fhir/build/implementations/java/org.hl7.fhir.utilities
```

check out this project into your eclipse workspace and adjust the paths in
src/ch/ahdis/fhir/r4/test/TutorialMapTests.java


## run the tutorial
for each step there is a directory below the maptutorial directory

logical: structurdefinitions for tleft, tright
map: maps
source: files used to transform
target: result of map transform (will be generated by the unittests)

run the unit test ...


## step1

TLeft --> TRight
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<TLeft xmlns="http://hl7.org/fhir/tutorial">
  <a>test</a>
</TLeft>
````

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<TRight xmlns="http://hl7.org/fhir/tutorial">
  <a>test</a>
</TRight>


## issues step3

currently working on

change it to:
```

rule_a20a: for source.a2 as a make target.a2 = truncate(a, 20)
rule_a20b: for source.a2 as a where a2.length() <= 20 make target.a2 = a
rule_a20c: for source.a2 as a check a2.length() <= 20 make target.a2 = a
```
after the where, check clause the name of the element from tleft has to be used (a2), after the make the variable which is assigned in the rule


## issues step4

Transfrom not supported yet.
added the cast transform for integer as wall as the function isInteger() to the FluentPathEngine
TODO: what other casts should be supported?

```
"rule_a21a" : for source.a21 as a make target.a21 = cast(a, "integer") // error if it's not an integer
"rule_a21b" : for source.a21 as a where a1.isInteger make target.a2 = cast(a, "integer") // ignore it
"rule_a21c" : for source.a21 as a where not at1.isInteger make target.a21 = 0 // just assign it 0
```

changed it to

```
  rule_a21a: for source.a21 as a make target.a21 = cast(a, "integer")
  rule_a21b: for source.a21 as a where a21.isInteger() make target.a21 = cast(a, "integer")
  rule_a21c: for source.a21 as a where a21.isInteger() = false make target.a21 = 0
```

### issues Step #5: Managing lists, part 1 

repeated elements were not working, improved patched for setProperty that primitive repeated elements get created.
  
### issues step #6: Managing lists, part 2 

```
rule_a23a : for source.a23 as a make target.a23 = a { only_one } // transform engine creates an error 
rule_a23b : for source.a23 as a make target.a23 = a  // leave error to lower layer; less informative
rule_a23c_1 : for source.a23 { first } as a make target.a23 = a // only use the first item in the list
```

first, only_one are not inside a  { } block as described in the tutorial
only_one is considered in the code currently the same as last
what does share me?
(see 		while (Utilities.existsInList(lexer.getCurrent(), "first", "last", "share", "only_one")) {


changed it to

```
rule_a23a: for source.a23 as a make target.a23 = a only_one
rule_a23b : for source.a23 as a make target.a23 = a  // leave error to lower layer; less informative
rule_a23c_1 : for source.a23 first as a make target.a23 = a // only use the first item in the list

```
